## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

You can use filter for drop-shadows similar to box-shadows. I had to convert the hsl value to rgb for the drop shadow, but I learned you can also use an hsla value to get opacity.

### Useful resources

- [Dimensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dimensions/baocaagndhipibgklemoalmkljaimfdj?hl=en) - This Chrome extension helped me measure sizes of the components.
